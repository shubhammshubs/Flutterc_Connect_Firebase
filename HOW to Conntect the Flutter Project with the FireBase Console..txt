HOW to Conntect the Flutter Project with the FireBase Console.



1. Create an flutter project and then with the same name create an an project on Firebase .

2. now inside the firebase project dashboard select the flutter option for connectivity.

3. Once you click on Flutter option you will see this ->  Add Firebase to your Flutter app
Inside you will have 4 different options =

1)
Prepare your workspace
	The easiest way to get you started is to use the FlutterFire CLI.

	Before you continue, make sure to:

	Install the Firebase CLI and log in (run firebase login)
	Install the Flutter SDK
	Create a Flutter project (run flutter create)


1.now in the first option select on =>  (Install the Firebase CLI) link 

from there download the recommanded version of Node.js

once node.js is downloaded install it on the system.

2. Once install you will be asked to run the following command in CMD prompt.

=> npm install -g firebase-tools

you possiblily see an message like this => 
changed/install 681 packages in 3m


3. then run the (firebase login) command on CMD
And login to you gmail accound on which the firebase is registede

4. Just to make sure every thing is going fine run the following command to check the projcet list =>

firebase projects:list

if you see all the project which is on the firebase then every thing is going good .

2) step 2 =
Install and run the FlutterFire CLI.


run this command on the cmd prompt once install you will see the message like this = 

Package flutterfire_cli is currently active at version 0.2.7.
The package flutterfire_cli is already activated at newest available version.
To recompile executables, first run `dart pub global deactivate flutterfire_cli`.
Installed executable flutterfire.
Activated flutterfire_cli 0.2.7.



NOTE=(If you got the worning on given path is not in the env then set the give path to the enviornment =>


in my case path is this  ->  C:\Users\Shubham\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin


also add this path too if not present already => C:\Users\Shubham\AppData\Roaming\npm.




once the path is set restart the PC else the you will still recive the same warning .

3. after resartng the pc run the above command again .

$. next run this coomand with the project name  =flutterfire configure --project=tryotpnew

run this command inside the project terminal => if all the setups are correct you will be asked to select the platforms for android,ios ,web etc.

select you desired platform with space bar and press enter to run the command . if every thing goes right you will recive this message with APP iD => 



PS C:\Users\Shubham\tryotpnew> flutterfire configure --project=tryotpnew
i Found 5 Firebase projects. Selecting project tryotpnew.
✔ Which platforms should your configuration support (use arrow keys & space to select)? · android, ios
i Firebase android app com.example.tryotpnew is not registered on Firebase project tryotpnew.
i Registered a new Firebase android app on Firebase project tryotpnew.
i Firebase ios app com.example.tryotpnew is not registered on Firebase project tryotpnew.
i Registered a new Firebase ios app on Firebase project tryotpnew.

Firebase configuration file lib\firebase_options.dart generated successfully with the following Firebase apps:

Platform  Firebase App Id
android   1:831137767600:android:1751634b1115174516db75
ios       1:831137767600:ios:7465aea0049fb3f116db75

Learn more about using this file and next steps from the documentation:
 > https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup


4. then you will find this file (firebase_options.dart) in your projects lib folder (lib/firebase_options.dart).

once the you open the lib/firebase_options.dart file you will notice few errors in the file for that we will be needed to import few packages 
in our pubspec.yaml.=>

the packages are =>     firebase_auth: ^4.12.0
  			firebase_core: ^2.20.0

install the lettest version .
you will see the error mark in the (firebase_options.dart)  is gone. 


5. Initialize Firebase and add plugins.

add the following code in your main().

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,

  );
runapp ....
}     
(THIS will make the connection with the firebase )


6) Now in the firebase console -> goto authentication on the left side menu .

select the desired service in my case i'll select the phone select on it press enable and save .


7) Now we need to Add Fingreprint of the flutter project .

for that go to flutter project -> inside the android you will find gradlew folder right click on that folder select open in Terminal.

now in the terminal run the following command =>  .\gradlew signingReport.



in output you will find  2 keys SHA1 and SHA256 key copy both keys and pest in firebase .

n firebase goto project overview/select android option /go to android setting 

at the bottom you will see add fingreprint option .
add both SHA1 and SHA256 .


now we are all setup for and ready to make our project run .


(NOTE:- firebase keep updating the console so some steps may change but overall process will always be the same.)
